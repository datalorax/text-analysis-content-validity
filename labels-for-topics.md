# Labels for Topics

## 3 Topics

1. Analyzing data and using evidence to understand organisms and systems
- there seems to be multiple types of content associated with this topic - those related to the life sciences (i.e., organisms, reproduction) and those related to the physical sciences (sun, motions), among others
2. Using scientific evidence to understand natural selection
- seeing the frequency of the word "traits" made me think this is focused on natural selection; not sure what "earth...s" is or should mean
3. Energy and mass
- there seems to be a strong content focus on the physical sciences (and using models to investigate energy and mass)

## 4 Topics

1. Analyzing data and using evidence to understand organisms and systems
- similar to topic 1 from the 3 topic solution
2.  Using scientific evidence to understand natural selection
- similar to topic 2 from the 3 topic solution
3. Energy
- similar to topic 3 from the 3 topic solution
4. Genetic information
- topic that wasn't clearly identifiable among those in the 3 topic solution; seems to be focused on the life sciences and on using genetic information (and perhaps using models to understand inheritance)

## 5 Topics

1. Analyzing data and using evidence to understand organisms and systems
- similar to topic 1 from the 3/4 topic solution
2. Using scientific evidence to understand natural selection
- somewhat hard to interpret because the "earth...s" term is now the most frequent term
- similar to topic 2 from the 3/4 topic solution
3. Energy
- similar to topic 3 from the 3/4 topic solution
4. Genetic information
- similar to topic 4 from the 4 topic solution
5. Scientific solutions
- this seems to be focused more on engineering design/technological solutions

## 6 Topics

1. Analyzing data and using evidence to understand organisms and systems
- similar to topic 1 from the 3/4/5 topic solution
2. Using scientific evidence to understand natural selection
- similar to topic 2 from the 3/4/5 topic solution
3. Energy
- similar to topic 3 from the 3/4/5 topic solution
4. Genetic information
- similar to topic 4 from the 4/5 topic solution
5. Scientific solutions
- similar to topic 5 from the 5 topic solution
6. Using evidence and models to understand energy
- this topic is new (though is soemwhat similar to topic 1 from the 3/4/5 topic solution due to the importance of evidence and model - but with a much greater focus on energy and physical sciences-related topics; also somewhat similar to topic 3 due to the focus on energy)
